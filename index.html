        <h3>Baking Algorithms</h3>
        <p>I find the creative process of baking is just like a coding algorithm. I love seeing raw ingredients come together under my very hands by some order. It's very rewarding to tuck into something knowing exactly what's gone into it and to know that it exists because of your own efforts!</p>
